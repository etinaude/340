micro kernals
	very small kernals, has abilty to do multi processing, most processes are at user level
	
monitors
	mutex and condition vars, give abilty to temporarily give up exclusive access to allow wait conditions to be met.\
	monitors can also be therad safe classes, objects and modules, which wrap a mutex
spin lock
	while (locked)... good for waiting a short time but the thread looks busy and will use up reasources, kernals often use spins
